Hello to ALL worlds!
Jar-Jar Binks was a great addition to the Star Wars franchise in that he added a much-desired (in my opinion) comedic role that would surprise us at the best of times that still has me laughing to this day - watch the behind the scenes/making-of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace; the way they filmed Jar-Jar is fu$^ing hilarious.
