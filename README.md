Hello to ALL worlds!

Jar-Jar Binks was a great addition to the Star Wars franchise in that he added a much-desired (in my opinion) comedic role that would surprise the viewers at any time.

If you watch the behind the scenes/making-of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace; you're in for a treat! The the way they filmed Jar-Jar is fu$^ing hilarious, you're welcome.
